# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      title: 'Background'
      content: '<p>The launch of the Future of Conservation Survey in 2017 triggered a series of requests from conservation organisations to be able to use the survey as an internal tool to characterise the range of views within groups and organisations. In response to these requests, we have created the Group and Organisation Future of Conservation Survey (GO-FOX).<p>The survey results generated internally within a group or organisation are made available to the GO-FOX user, to facilitate a discussion about the results within the group. Examples of how GO-FOX may be used include, but are not limited to:</p><ul>
      <li>Conservation NGOs wishing to generate discussion amongst their members around current debates in conservation, for example as part of a strategic planning process.</li>
      <li>Teachers in conservation courses who wish to use the tool  for an interactive learning session to stimulate a series of discussions around controversial topics in conservation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To run GO-FOX for your group or organisation, <a href="/users/sign_in">create a GO-FOX account.</a></p>
      <p>You can also find out more about how GO-FOX works in the GO-FOX support page (link), and about the overall Future of Conservation/GO-FOX projects by watching the video below.</p>
