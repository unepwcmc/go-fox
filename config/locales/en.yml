Recent debates about the future of conservation have been dominated by a few high-profile individuals, whose views seem to fit fairly neatly into polarised positions. In this survey, we are exploring the range of views that exist within the conservation movement globally, and how this varies by key demographic characteristics such as age, gender, geography and educational background.</p>'

      content: '<p>After taking the survey, the website will present your views on a plot with three axes, relating to the role that people should play in conservation, the roles of scientific evidence and protected areas, and the relationship between conservation and capitalism, respectively. These axes were derived from the first published statistical analysis of the Future of Conservation database (9,264 respondents at the time; see *link to paper* for further details), and correspond to each of the three main dimensions of variation in conservation thinking therein.</p>
      <p>Your position on each dimension is situated relative to a ‘neutral point’ (the score which would be obtained if one answered ‘neither agree nor disagree’ to every statement), as well as relative to the average position from our global dataset.</p>
      <p>We have published, and aim to continue to publish, our findings on the views of conservationists in various ways. Where possible, we will include these on this website (see links below).

          title: 'Q: What happened to the two-dimension results and figure that I saw last time I took this survey?'
          content: '<p>A: The original two dimensions for the Future of Conservation Survey were created by the project team based on their expert understanding of recent conservation debates. However, now that over 10,000 people have taken the survey, we have generated new dimensions that are based on patterns in the way respondents have answered the questions. The best solution to this analysis has three dimensions rather than two, which is why the site has changed. We recognise that this change makes the results somewhat more complex to understand and interpret, but feel it is important to present results that are accurate rather than convenient!</p>'

          title: 'Q: For some statements my answer would depend on the context - in some situations I would agree, and others I would disagree - but this isn’t covered by the response options I am given to choose from.'
          content: '<p>A: This is a fair point, but we hope and assume that when faced with such a situation respondents will choose the mid point of the choices (labeled ‘neither agree nor disagree’), or close to the mid point if they think that on average they lean slightly towards agree/disagree on that question. If this happens then the survey is working well, because some other people will have unambiguous views about the same question and will choose ‘strongly agree’ or ‘strongly disagree’. In this way the survey is effective at revealing the difference between people who have mixed or nuanced views versus those who hold strong positions regardless of the context.</p>'
        -
          title: 'Q: The survey uses a quantitative approach, but the issues involved are complex and require qualitative data. There should be more opportunities to enter qualitative answers in the survey.'
          content: '<p>A: We agree that the issues are complex, and we regularly use qualitative data in our own research. Indeed, the statements we used for the Future of Conservation Survey were first developed for a small sample size Q methodology study, which is a mixed quant/qual methodology. That study revealed some distinct ways of thinking about the issues covered by the Future of Conservation Survey, and in this project we wanted to see how prevalent these views might be in the wider conservation community and what factors might explain the views people hold. To do this we opted for a quantitative approach with a large sample size. It is worth noting that had we received the same number of survey responses (now 11000+) with detailed qualitative data we would have had no prospect of analysing all the survey responses.</p>'
        -
          title: 'Q: This is an exercise that oversimplifies the debate and is fundamentally reductive.'
          content: '<p>A: We recognize that this is a relatively reductionist way of examining the issues, but we propose (and much of the feedback we’ve had indicates) that it is still useful to show the range of issues and allow people to explore one characterization of their position compared with those of other conservationists. In this particular research, we have prioritized breadth over depth: we were acutely aware that people would be less responsive to a survey taking more than roughly 15 minutes to complete, hence the choice to work with quantitative data related to pre-prepared statements that people could respond to relatively intuitively using a simple spectrum of agreement. We have now launched a version of the survey which can be taken internally by groups and organisations (*link*), with the survey serving as platform for more nuanced and detailed discussion.</p>
          <p>We recognise that the three axes presented in the figure on the results page do not cover the full breadth of issues at stake in debates about the future of conservation, and indeed many of the questions in the survey do not contribute to respondents’ scores on these axes. This is why we have included an open question at the end of the survey, which asks respondents to contribute other issues which they think are pertinent to the future of conservation, but which were not at the time included in the survey. If there are other issues which you would like to see included in the survey, that is the place to suggest them (if you have already taken the survey, feel free to get in touch with us directly: futureofconservation@gmail.com).</p>'
        -
          title: 'Q: The wording of some of the questions is problematic, making it difficult to know how to answer.'
          content: '<p>A: The survey went through a lengthy period of testing, but like all social surveys, we accept that not all the statements are perfect and that some people will dislike some of them. It is important to note that as the survey was intended to discover how conservationists responded to the points made in the new conservation debate in the literature. Many of the statements are direct quotes from published articles in that debate.</p>'
        -
          title: 'Q: I really don’t agree with where I appeared in the final plot.'
          content: '<p>A: This is unfortunate, but we are confident that the mechanism that generates your scores on each dimension is working correctly and that the vast majority of respondents consider that their location represents their views. It is worth noting a few things: (1) we are careful to say that “your position appears most closely aligned with X” rather than “you are an X” - recognising that the survey cannot be a perfect tool and that labelling can be unhelpful. (2) You may be very close to the dividing line between quadrants on one or both of the axes. In that case, it is worth thinking about whether your viewpoint really sits between the two positions, rather than in the one to which you have been assigned. (3) If you feel you are in completely the wrong place, it might be possible that you answered one or more questions incorrectly by not noticing the negative wording of the statement – e.g. if you answer that you strongly disagree with the statement “There is no significant conservation value in highly modified landscapes”, then you are in effect saying that you do think there is significant conservation value in highly modified landscapes.</p>'

          title: 'Q: Isn’t this just an academic exercise? What difference can it make?'
          content: '<p>A: We certainly want this survey to be more than just an academic exercise, and we see it as one stage of a process rather than an end in itself. We are delighted that it has already stimulated so much debate, and think that this is in itself very useful for the conservation community. At the request of several conservation NGOs, we have also developed a version of the survey which can be run for a defined group, like colleagues within an organisation or a student cohort (*link*). We have so far received very positive feedback from the organisations involved, in terms of encouraging internal debate and informing strategic planning.

          title: 'Q: Why these questions? By limiting the questions to the issues already covered in the New Conservation debate, aren’t you reproducing its limitations?'
          content: '<p>A: This is a fair point. Our research began as an investigation into how members of the wider conservation community felt about the issues raised in the new conservation debate, and that is what we have continued with this survey. These debates are broad enough to cover many key issues in conservation. But we do recognise that there are other important issues that matter for the future of conservation that have not featured in the New Conservation debate, which is why we have now included an open-ended question at the end of the survey which allows respondents to contribute new topics which they feel are pertinent to the future of conservation. We plan to consider these suggestions to produce new statements, to be then incorporated into the survey.</p>'
        -
          title: 'Q: The questions are leading questions, and this is poor research design.'
          content: '<p>A: Please note that the survey is based on statements, rather than questions, and therefore cannot be considered leading. The statements are phrased as Likert items and are sometimes deliberately provocative such that they elicit responses with a spectrum of agreement. This is conventional in social science.</p>'

In response to these requests, we have created the Group and Organisation Future of Conservation Survey (GO-FOX).</p>
      <p>The GO-FOX tool allows the user to create their own unique version of the Future of Conservation Survey and distribute it to a closed group of respondents they are working with. Analysed survey results from this group are then made available to the GO-FOX user, who can then use them for the benefit of the group. Examples of how GO-FOX may be used include, but are not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Conservation NGOs wishing to generate discussion amongst their staff or members about their individual conservation viewpoints and how these relate to the work of the organisation. This could be done as part of a strategic planning process</li>
      <li>Teachers in conservation courses who wish to use the tool to support learning about diverse perspectives in conservation and self-reflection of students on their own views</li>

      title: 'Framing the debate'
      content: '<p>Although discussions about the aims and methods of conservation probably date back as far as conservation itself, the ‘new conservation’ debate as such was sparked by Kareiva and Marvier’s 2012 article entitled What is conservation science?</p>
      <p>Two prominent positions have emerged in this debate, that of Kareiva and Marvier, which we label ‘new conservation’, and a strongly opposed viewpoint that we label ‘traditional conservation’ (see diagram below).
      <p>These positions can be clearly distinguished by their views on the role of people in conservation (top axis in diagram below), the role of science and strict protected areas (middle axis), and that of corporations and capitalism (bottom axis).</p>
      <p>However, our research (*links to Holmes et al and Sandbrook et al*) suggests that many conservationists hold different views, or different combinations of the views expressed by new and traditional conservationists. This page describes the main positions identified in the literature about the ‘new conservation’ debate.</p>'
    -
      link: 'New Conservation'
      title: 'New Conservation'
      content: '<p>Central to the ‘new conservation’ position is a shift towards viewing conservation as being about protecting nature in order to improve human wellbeing (especially that of the poor), rather than for biodiversity’s own sake (hence the relatively high score on the people-centred conservation axis). </p>
      <p>‘New conservationists’ believe that win-win situations in which people benefit from conservation can often be achieved by promoting economic growth and partnering with corporations, which is why most new conservationists tend to score relatively high on the conservation through capitalism axis.</p>
      <p>Where new conservationists stand on the second dimension, scientific protectionism, is harder to say. On the one hand, new conservationists often criticise conservation approaches which mainly focus on protected areas, making their score on this dimension lower than for other positions, such as traditional conservation. Nonetheless, judging by the published literature, new conservation advocates are generally enthusiastic about conservation goals being based on evidence from the natural sciences, potentially making their score on this axis slightly less negative than that of critical social scientists, who often highlight the importance of the social sciences and the humanities.</p>
      <p>Although new conservation advocates have been criticised for doing away with nature’s intrinsic value, key authors within the movement have responded by clarifying that their motive is not so much an ethical as a strategic or pragmatic one. In other words, they claim that conservation needs to emphasise nature’s instrumental value to people because this better promotes support for conservation compared to arguments based solely on species’ rights to exist.</p>

      link: 'Traditional conservation'
      title: 'Traditional conservation'
      content: '<p>Traditional conservationists often support the protection of nature for its own sake, often advocating the use of protected areas as the main tool for conservation (hence the high score on the scientific protectionism dimension).</p>
      <p>This emphasis on nature’s intrinsic value typically leads traditional conservation advocates to score relatively negatively on the people-centred conservation dimension, as key figures, such as Michael Soulé, have claimed that conservation should be distinct from humanitarianism, and that, whilst the alleviation of poverty is of general moral concern, this should not become the primary focus of conservation organisations.</p>
      <p>Traditional conservationists tend to also be critical of markets and economic growth as tools for conservation. This is because they believe that by embracing markets, we run the risk of ‘selling out nature’ by neglecting species that may be considered to be of little economic value. What’s more, economic growth itself is seen as a major driver of threats to biodiversity.</p>

      link: 'Critical social science'
      title: 'Critical social science'
      content: '<p>According to critical social scientists, the impacts of conservation on human wellbeing should be at the forefront of the conservation debate (hence the positive score on the people-centred conservation dimension).</p>
      <p>This entails being critical of negative side-effects that conservation activities might have on people who are economically poor and/or politically marginalised, for example evictions to make space for protected areas (scientific protectionism), and also employing conservation initiatives as a means of improving human welfare.</p>
      <p>However, critical social scientists tend to be sceptical of the ability of markets and capitalism to deliver benefits for both nature and people. For example, the economic valuation of nature might be perceived as a corporate strategy to open up avenues for its exploitation, whilst concealing the negative impacts of such activities by manipulating the way in which these activities are presented to the public.</p>
      <p>This position is sometimes critiqued by others for offering a strong diagnosis of what is wrong with conservation practice, whilst failing to offer practical alternatives.</p>

      link: 'Market ecocentrism'
      title: 'Market ecocentrism'
      content: '<p>Perhaps one example of ‘market ecocentrism’ is the recent Nature Needs Half movement (as well as the closely related Half-Earth movement). In his book entitled ‘Half-Earth’, biologist Edward O. Wilson advocates the setting aside of half of the world’s area as ‘inviolable nature reserves’ (scientific protectionism). Aware that this ambitious target would require a drastic decrease in per capita environmental footprint worldwide, Wilson supports free markets as a means to favour those products which generate the maximum profit for the minimum energy and resource consumption.</p>
      <p>However, Wilson’s pro-markets view seems to be more to do with ensuring that humanity can flourish on only 50% of the Earth’s surface rather than as a tool for carrying out conservation: that is, the pro-market strategy would be used to buffer the ‘human’ half of the Earth against the need to exploit the ‘natural’ half, rather than as a means to create economic value from protecting the ‘natural’ half.</p>
      <p>Other instances of market ecocentrism include strategies in which market tools, such as ecotourism and ‘willingness to pay’ approaches are used to generate revenue to fund the creation and maintenance of protected areas.</p>
