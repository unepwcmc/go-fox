Recent debates about the future of conservation have been dominated by a few high-profile individuals, whose views seem to fit fairly neatly into polarised positions. In this survey, we are exploring the range of views that exist within the conservation movement globally, and how this varies by key demographic characteristics such as age, gender, geography and educational background.</p>

        -
          title: 'Q: What happened to the two-dimension results and figure that I saw last time I took this survey?'
          content: '<p>A: The original two dimensions for the Future of Conservation Survey were created by the project team based on their expert understanding of recent conservation debates. However, now that over 10,000 people have taken the survey, we have generated new dimensions that are based on patterns in the way respondents have answered the questions. The best solution to this analysis has three dimensions rather than two, which is why the site has changed. We recognise that this change makes the results somewhat more complex to understand and interpret, but feel it is important to present results that are accurate rather than convenient!</p>'
        -
          title: 'Q: For some statements my answer would depend on the context - in some situations I would agree, and others I would disagree - but this isn’t covered by the response options I am given to choose from.'
          content: '<p>A: This is a fair point, but we hope and assume that when faced with such a situation respondents will choose the mid point of the choices (labeled ‘neutral’), or close to the mid point if they think that on average they lean slightly towards agree/disagree on that question. If this happens then the survey is working well, because some other people will have unambiguous views about the same question and will choose ‘strongly agree’ or ‘strongly disagree’. In this way the survey is effective at revealing the difference between people who have mixed or nuanced views versus those who hold strong positions regardless of the context.</p>'
        -
          title: 'Q: The survey uses a quantitative approach, but the issues involved are complex and require qualitative data. There should be more opportunities to enter qualitative answers in the survey.'
          content: '<p>A: We agree that the issues are complex, and we regularly use qualitative data in our own research. Indeed, the statements we used for the Future of Conservation Survey were first developed for a small sample size Q methodology study, which is a mixed quant/qual methodology. That study revealed some distinct ways of thinking about the issues covered by the Future of Conservation Survey, and in this project we wanted to see how prevalent these views might be in the wider conservation community and what factors might explain the views people hold. To do this we opted for a quantitative approach with a large sample size. It is worth noting that had we received the same number of survey responses (now 14000+) with detailed qualitative data we would have had no prospect of analysing all the survey responses.</p>'
        -
          title: 'Q: This is an exercise that oversimplifies the debate and is fundamentally reductive.'
          content: '<p>A: We recognize that this is a relatively reductionist way of examining the issues, but we propose (and much of the feedback we’ve had indicates) that it is still useful to show the range of issues and allow people to explore one characterization of their position compared with those of other conservationists. In this particular research, we have prioritized breadth over depth: we were acutely aware that people would be less responsive to a survey taking more than roughly 15 minutes to complete, hence the choice to work with quantitative data related to pre-prepared statements that people could respond to relatively intuitively using a simple spectrum of agreement. We have now launched a version of the survey which can be taken internally by <a href="/about-go-fox" title="Visit the About Go-FOX page">groups and organisations</a>, with the survey serving as platform for more nuanced and detailed discussion.</p>
          <p>We recognise that the three axes presented in the figure on the results page do not cover the full breadth of issues at stake in debates about the future of conservation, and indeed many of the questions in the survey do not contribute to respondents’ scores on these axes. This is why we have included an open question at the end of the survey, which asks respondents to contribute other issues which they think are pertinent to the future of conservation, but which were not at the time included in the survey. If there are other issues which you would like to see included in the survey, that is the place to suggest them (if you have already taken the survey, feel free to get in touch with us directly: <a href="mailto:futureofconservation@gmail.com" title="Email Future of Conservation">futureofconservation@gmail.com</a>).</p>'
        -
          title: 'Q: The wording of some of the questions is problematic, making it difficult to know how to answer.'
          content: '<p>A: The survey went through a lengthy period of testing, but like all social surveys, we accept that not all the statements are perfect and that some people will dislike some of them. It is important to note that as the survey was intended to discover how conservationists responded to the points made in the new conservation debate in the literature. Many of the statements are direct quotes from published articles in that debate.</p>'
        -
          title: 'Q: Isn’t this just an academic exercise? What difference can it make?'
          content: '<p>A: We certainly want this survey to be more than just an academic exercise, and we see it as one stage of a process rather than an end in itself. We are delighted that it has already stimulated so much debate, and think that this is in itself very useful for the conservation community. At the request of several conservation NGOs, we have also developed <a href="/about-go-fox" title="Visit the About Go-FOX page">GO-FOX</a>, a version of the survey which can be run for a defined group, like colleagues within an organisation or a student cohort. We have so far received very positive feedback from the organisations involved, in terms of encouraging internal debate and informing strategic planning. We would be delighted to hear from you at <a href="mailto:futureofconservation@gmail.com" title="Email Future of Conservation">futureofconservation@gmail.com</a> if you would be interested to take part.</p>'
        -
          title: 'Q: Can this survey be run for just my group / organisation?'
          content: '<p>A: Several groups have already approached us asking for a closed survey for only their group, and we have responded to the demand by creating <a href="/about-go-fox" title="Visit the About Go-FOX page" title="About Go-Fox">GO-FOX</a>, a separate version of the survey which can be run internally within a group or organisation.</p>'
        -
          title: 'Q: Why these questions? By limiting the questions to the issues already covered in the New Conservation debate, aren’t you reproducing its limitations?'
          content: '<p>A: This is a fair point. Our research began as an investigation into how members of the wider conservation community felt about the issues raised in the new conservation debate, and that is what we have continued with this survey. These debates are broad enough to cover many key issues in conservation. But we do recognise that there are other important issues that matter for the future of conservation that have not featured in the New Conservation debate, which is why we have now included an open-ended question at the end of the survey which allows respondents to contribute new topics which they feel are pertinent to the future of conservation. We plan to consider these suggestions to produce new statements, to be then incorporated into the survey.</p>'
        -
          title: 'Q: The questions are leading questions, and this is poor research design.'
          content: '<p>A: Please note that the survey is based on statements, rather than questions, and therefore cannot be considered leading. The statements are phrased as Likert items and are sometimes deliberately provocative such that they elicit responses with a spectrum of agreement. This is conventional in social science.</p>'

      When you create your account you need to answer a few simple questions about your group or organisation. At the end of the signup process you need to indicate whether you expect to use GO-FOX as an educational tool (e.g. in a classroom setting) or for organisational capacity development (e.g. for strategy development). If you wish to use the tool for both, you will need to create two separate accounts, one for each.

      <p>
      Each time you wish to use GO-FOX with a new group, you will need to create a new survey. To do this, navigate to the “Surveys” page, and then click the “Create new survey” button. You will then see a series of questions that help us to understand how you plan to use the survey for your particular group or organisation. Here you should answer for the specific people who will be taking the survey, rather than answering for your own organisation or group. For example, when signing up, you may have answered for the NGO or University you work for, whereas when creating a survey, you might be describing a specific group of students, or those participating in a workshop.
      </p>
      <p>
      You are able to create up to three bespoke questions to help you to explore differences between sub-groups among your respondents. Each question has to be multiple choice, and respondents will only be able to select one answer. Good examples would be questions like “how many years have you worked for X”, where the answers are in pre-defined categories, or “which regional programme do you work for”. You can create a new question by clicking on “Add custom question”. You then write your full question text into the “Customised question title” box. This is what your respondent will see in the main survey. To create an answer category click on “Add question”, then writing the answer option into the “Option text” box. Repeat this process for up to 10 options per question.

      The “Visualise your responses” tab will show the distribution of answers to all the survey questions. The % figure on the left is the total proportion of respondents who disagreed with the statement (across all three levels of disagreement), the middle % is those who neither agreed nor disagreed, and the % figure on the right is the total proportion of your respondents who agreed with the statement.

      <p>
      The “Summarise agreement” tab helps you to identify areas of agreement and disagreement between your respondents and the approximately 10,000 people who have taken the Future of Conservation Survey around the world. The red dot for each question shows the mean response in the global survey, whereas the black dot shows the mean response from your group, +/- the standard error. If the black dot is above the red dot then your group tended to agree with the statement more than the global sample, and vice versa.

      The “Visualise your scores (3D)” tab allows you to explore the scores of your respondents on the three dimensions of conservation thinking identified in the Future of Conservation Survey research.

You can toggle on and off the scores for your respondents on each dimension, and the lines linking them together. Each line connects the scores on each dimension of one respondent, allowing you to get a sense of their overall position on the future of conservation. Further information about how to interpret results across all three dimensions can be found on the <a href="/about-the-debate?locale=en" title="About the debate">About the debate</a> page. The “show neutral points?” button turns on and off the small circles on each dimension in the figure. These represent the score that a respondent would get if they answered “neither agree nor disagree” to every question. This helps you to interpret respondent scores on each dimension, because in some cases respondents can get a low score on a dimension despite agreeing with the ideas it contains. This is because they do so less strongly than the average respondent.
      </p>
      <p>
      The right hand side of the “Visualise your scores (3D)” tab allows you to explore differences between your respondents according to any bespoke questions you created in your survey. In the “Group by custom question?” box you can choose which question to explore. In the “Choose group to be highlighted” box you can then pick particular answer categories to highlight. This allows you to look for any clear differences between your respondents according to which category they are in.
      </p>
      <p>
      The “Visualise your scores (2D)” tab allows you to do very similar analysis to that described above, but choosing two of the three dimensions at a time. The dotted line in the figure represents the ‘neutral’ score of a respondent who answered “neither agree nor disagree” to every question. Again you can look at differences between groups identified by your bespoke questions using the “Group by custom question?” box.
      </p>
      <p>
      The “Descriptive statistics” tab gives you text analysis that helps you to understand the compare your respondents to those of the global Future of Conservation Survey, and the five statements with the most agreement, disagreement, consensus, and polarisation respectively. The latter represent the five statements about which your respondents had the most divergent responses, which can be particularly useful to think about.
      </p>
      <p>
      Finally, you can download the key figures from your analysis by clicking on the “Download summaries” tab. If you want any images that include the analysis of your bespoke questions, you will need to right click on the desired image and save it directly to your computer.

      content: '<p>The launch of the Future of Conservation Survey in 2017 triggered a series of requests from conservation organisations to be able to use the survey as an internal tool to characterise the range of views within groups and organisations. In response to these requests, we have created the Group and Organisation Future of Conservation Survey (GO-FOX).</p>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bZdwQAG-xl4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>The GO-FOX tool allows the user to create their own unique version of the Future of Conservation Survey and distribute it to a closed group of respondents they are working with. Analysed survey results from this group are then made available to the GO-FOX user, who can then use them for the benefit of the group. Examples of how GO-FOX may be used include, but are not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Conservation NGOs wishing to generate discussion amongst their staff or members about their individual conservation viewpoints and how these relate to the work of the organisation. This could be done as part of a strategic planning process</li>
      <li>Teachers in conservation courses who wish to use the tool to support learning about diverse perspectives in conservation and self-reflection of students on their own views</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To get started, just <a href="/users/sign_in?locale=en" title="Register GO-FOX account">register your GO-FOX account</a> and start creating surveys!</p>
      <p>Funding for GO-FOX has been received from the Cambridge Conservation Initiative Collaborative Fund, which is supported by the Arcadia Fund, and from the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Impact Acceleration Account at the University of Edinburgh. We are very grateful for the support of these donors.</p>'

      title: 'About the Future of Conservation debate'
      content: '<p>Although discussions about the aims and methods of conservation probably date back as far as conservation itself, the ‘new conservation’ debate as such was sparked by Kareiva and Marvier’s 2012 article entitled <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/62/11/962/263056" title="Visit the ‘What is conservation science’ paper" target="_blank">‘What is conservation science?’</a>.</p>
      <p>Two prominent positions emerged in this debate, that of Kareiva and Marvier, which they called ‘new conservation’, and a strongly opposed viewpoint that we label ‘traditional conservation’. Our research emerged from our concern that these two positions did not adequately describe the range of views held by conservationists around the world.</p>
      <p>The new and traditional conservation positions can be clearly distinguished by their views on the role of ‘people-centred conservation’ (relating to the role that people should play in conservation), ‘science-led ecocentrism’ (relating to the role of science in the conservation of species and ecosystems), and ‘conservation through capitalism’ (relating to the role of corporations and market based approaches in conservation).</p>
      <p>This page describes these positions, as well as <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/cobi.12811" title="Visit the paper ‘Understanding conservationists’ perspectives on the new‐conservation debate’" target="_blank">two others that have been previously identified in the literature</a> about the ‘new conservation’ debate. Using diagrams, it also shows how these positions relate to the three axes identified by <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-019-0267-5" title="Visit our paper in Nature Sustainability" target="_blank">our research</a>. However, our work suggests that many conservationists do not belong to any of these four positions; or they hold different combinations of the views expressed in the literature. We include descriptions of these four positions here for information, but support efforts to move beyond characterising conservationists into separate ‘camps’.</p>'

      title: 'New Conservation'
      content: '<p>Central to the ‘new conservation’ position is a shift towards viewing conservation as being about protecting nature in order to improve human wellbeing (especially that of the poor), rather than for biodiversity’s own sake (hence the relatively high score on the people-centred conservation axis).</p>
      <p>‘New conservationists’ believe that win-win situations in which people benefit from conservation can often be achieved by promoting economic growth and partnering with corporations, corresponding to a high score on the ‘conservation through capitalism’ axis.</p>
      <p>Where new conservationists stand on the second dimension, science-led ecocentrism, is harder to say. On the one hand, new conservationists often criticise conservation approaches which mainly focus on protected areas, making their score on this dimension lower than for other positions, such as traditional conservation. Nonetheless, judging by the published literature, new conservation advocates are generally enthusiastic about conservation goals being based on evidence from the natural sciences, potentially making their score on this axis slightly less negative than that of critical social scientists, who often highlight the importance of input from other disciplines.</p>
      <p>Although new conservation advocates have been criticised for doing away with nature’s intrinsic value, key authors within the movement have responded by clarifying that their motive is not so much an ethical as a strategic or pragmatic one. In other words, they claim that conservation needs to emphasise nature’s instrumental value to people because this better promotes support for conservation compared to arguments based solely on the rights of species to exist.</p>'

      link: 'Traditional conservation'
      title: 'Traditional conservation'
      content: '<p>Traditional conservationists often support the protection of nature for its own sake, often advocating the use of protected areas as the main tool for conservation (hence the high score on the science-led ecocentrism dimension).</p>
      <p>This emphasis on nature’s intrinsic value typically leads traditional conservation advocates to score relatively negatively on the people-centred conservation dimension, as key figures, such as Michael Soulé, have claimed that conservation should be distinct from humanitarianism, and that, whilst the alleviation of poverty is of general moral concern, this should not become the primary focus of conservation organisations.</p>
      <p>Traditional conservationists tend to also be critical of markets and economic growth as tools for conservation. This is because they believe that by embracing markets, we run the risk of ‘selling out nature’ by neglecting species that may be considered to be of little economic value. What’s more, economic growth itself is seen as a major driver of threats to biodiversity.</p>'

      title: 'Critical social science'
      content: '<p>According to what we call the critical social science position, the impacts of conservation on human wellbeing should be at the forefront of the conservation debate (hence the positive score on the people-centred conservation dimension). This entails being critical of conservation activities that can have negative effects on people, such as creating protected areas. It is also critical of a nature-for-nature’s sake rationale for conservation and the use of natural science within conservation (hence the negative score on the science-led ecocentrism dimension).</p>
      <p>Critical social scientists tend to be sceptical of the ability of markets and capitalism to deliver benefits for both nature and people. For example, the economic valuation of nature might be perceived as a corporate strategy to open up avenues for its exploitation, whilst concealing the negative impacts of such activities by manipulating the way in which these activities are presented to the public (hence the negative score on conservation through capitalism).</p>
      <p>This position is sometimes critiqued by others for offering a strong diagnosis of what is wrong with conservation practice, whilst failing to offer practical alternatives.</p>'

      link: 'Market ecocentrism'
      title: 'Market ecocentrism'
      content: '<p>Perhaps one example of ‘market ecocentrism’ is the recent Nature Needs Half movement (as well as the closely related Half-Earth movement). In his book entitled ‘Half-Earth’, biologist Edward O. Wilson uses scientific arguments about biogeography to advocate the setting aside of half of the world’s area as ‘inviolable nature reserves’. The motivation for these reserves would predominantly be to protect species and ecosystems for their own sakes; hence the positive score on the science-led ecocentrism dimension, and the relatively negative score on the people-centred conservation dimension. Aware that this ambitious target would require a drastic decrease in per capita environmental footprint worldwide, Wilson supports free markets as a means to favour those products which generate the maximum profit for the minimum energy and resource consumption (hence the positive score on the conservation through capitalism dimension).</p>
      <p>However, Wilson’s pro-markets view seems to be more to do with ensuring that humanity can flourish on only 50% of the Earth’s surface rather than as a tool for carrying out conservation: that is, the pro-market strategy would be used to buffer the ‘human’ half of the Earth against the need to exploit the ‘natural’ half, rather than as a means to create economic value from protecting the ‘natural’ half.</p>
      <p>Other instances of market ecocentrism include strategies in which market tools, such as ecotourism and ‘willingness to pay’ approaches are used to generate revenue to fund the creation and maintenance of protected areas.</p>'

    title: "How to interpret your results"
    content: '<p>
    The plot above presents a summary of your views (the bold points and lines) on three axes. These axes represent three key dimensions of the conservation debate derived from statistical analysis of results from the first 9,264 respondents to the Future of Conservation survey. These dimensions are: A ‘people-centred conservation’ (relating to the role that people should play in conservation), B ‘science-led ecocentrism’ (relating to the role of science in the conservation of species and ecosystems), and C ‘conservation through capitalism’ (relating to the role of corporations and market based approaches in conservation).
    </p>
    <p>
    A score towards the left hand side of the plot is less in favour of the relevant dimension, whereas a score to the right hand side of the plot is more in favour of the dimension.
    </p>
    <p>
    You can compare your views with other people who have recently taken the survey, whose answers are represented by the small points and thin lines.
