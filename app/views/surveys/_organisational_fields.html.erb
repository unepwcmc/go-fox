  Do you want respondents to your survey to be anonymous? If no, respondents' names will be visible in outputs intended to be shared with the group. Respondents will be made aware of this and reminded of their right to refuse to participate. You should think carefully about whether anonymity is appropriate, and may wish to consult your group in advance on their preferences around this.

  If you wish to, you can view results broken into subgroups. To do so, please add subgroup names below so that they can be added to the survey. Respondents will be able to choose only one, so they should be mutually exclusive.
